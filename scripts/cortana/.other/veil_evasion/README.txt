into Armitage/Cobalt Strike under 'Attacks' -> 'Veil-Evasion'


On loading, the installation path for Veil-Evasion will be prompted for.

Payloads can (optionally) be set to be substituted into PSEXEC calls on the fly.

Existing Cobalt Strike listeners can be selected and appropriate options will
be filled in.

On generation, payload options are saved, even across restarts of Armitage/Cobalt Strike.


Double-clicking 'Payload' will dynamically load the payloads available in
the associated Veil-Evasion install.

Double-clicking 'MSFPayload' will bring up a list of compatible
metasploit shellcode specifications.
