The goal of this library is to do a good job of recovering static structure.

We should develop an automated testing framework to take in binaries, and
compare the results of CFG recovery stripped and unstripped with DWARF. Variable
recovery and stuff should eventually all live here.

We could also have the testing framework compare against IDA, since we can script it.
